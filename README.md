- **COMPOSER** : as a package or dependency manager plays a vital role in helping us manage some of these dependencies which our application requires for optimal performance by                    saving them on a folder, most times the “vendor” folder.

     This idea of dependency management is not a new concept, as composer was largely inspired by NPM a dependency manager for NodeJS and BUNDLER, a dependency                          manager of Ruby.

     Think of it this way:

     Your project depends on this number of libraries.
                 Some of these libraries/packages, depend on other sets of libraries or packages What then will composer do for you?
                 Composer enables you to declare those set libraries your project will be depending on.
                 It also checks for the version of these libraries best suited for your application and installs them for you by downloading them and their dependencies into your                  project directory.
                 Hence Composer eliminates that worry of having struggle to get the original library the package you intend to use in your application depends on.


- **ORM** : object-relational mapper (ORM) that makes it enjoyable to interact with your database. ... In addition to retrieving records from the database table, Eloquent models               allow you to insert, update, and delete records from the table as well .
- **ARTISAN** : The Laravel PHP artisan serve command helps running applications on the PHP development server .

- **MIGRATION** : Migration provides a way for easily sharing the schema of the database. It also makes the modification of the schema much easier. It is like creating a schema                     once and then sharing it many times .
